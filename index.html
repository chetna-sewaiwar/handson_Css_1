    <h2>What is css</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Css stands for Cascading style Sheet</li>
        
        <li>Css describe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen , paper or in other media.</li>
    
        <li><span class="through">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="mark">Css saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="italic">External stylesheets are storted in css files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Css can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using a style attribute inside html elements 1</li>
        <li>internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external Css files. However,<span class="mark"> In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="color">When comparing Css class vs ID, the diffrence is that Css class applies a style to multiple elements . ID, on the other hand applies to a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directlyto an element and it's ude by java script.  </p>
    <p class="color">In Css se;actor are use to target a specific element or range of  element of web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="color">There is a wide range of selectors aviable. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
